Hey everyone, welcome to the first official tutorial for AAVJ. This is Jack, AKA Anti-Alias, and in this video we’re going to be taking a look at AAVJ - a VJ mixer I created within TouchDesigner.

AAVJ leverages the amazing front and back end functionality of TouchDesigner to allow for real-time content and other inputs or outputs TouchDesigner supports.

The interface is intended to be user-friendly, customizable, and designed to work in tandem with other industry VJ software.

Let’s take a look at the interface. Yay
